:icons: font

To run any of the examples, replace `k8s-project` with your GCP project ID.
These examples are made to work with the latest release of skaffold.

If you are running skaffold at HEAD or have built it from source, please use the examples at integration/examples.

If you wish to make changes to these examples, please edit the ones at integration/examples, as those will be synced on release.
